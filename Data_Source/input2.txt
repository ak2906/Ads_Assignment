With the availability of genome data for COVID-19 publicly on National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). 
I wanted to see how similar was the 2019 novel coronavirus when compared to other coronaviruses.
In this article, I will compare the reference genome of COVID-19 with the reference genomes of two different coronaviruses discovered previously; 
one human coronavirus and one bat coronavirus.
Oligonucleotide composition
An oligonucleotide is considered to be a contiguous string of a small number of nucleotides.
In computational terms, we define oligonucleotides as k-mers (words of size k). 
In this comparison, I have considered 3-mers and their composition (trinucleotide composition). 
There are 32 (4Â³/2) distinct 3-mers. 
We obtain the normalised frequencies of each distinct trinucleotide by counting the number of occurrences of that trinucleotide and dividing by the total number of trinucleotides. 
We normalise these counts to avoid any unevenness caused due to different lengths of sequences.
1. SARS coronavirus
This is the reference genome of the SARS coronavirus ZJ0301 reported from China which has been published in the year 2003
2. Bat SARS-like coronavirus isolate bat-SL-CoVZC45
This is the reference genome of the bat SARS-like coronavirus which is considered to be very closely related to COVID-19.
3.CoVid-19
This is the latest reference genome published on NCBI for the 2019 novel coronavirus.
